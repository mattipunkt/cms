## Installation
Soon...™

## Development
Developing works on Linux and MacOS. Windows should also work, but has not been tested yet.
Install PHP and Laravel. (I recommend using [Laravel Herd Lite](https://php.new))

Clone the git repo and copy `.env.example` to `.env`. Change the values as you like.
To start developing run the two commands before you can start developing.
```bash
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
```

Now you are ready to go. To run the project run
```
composer run dev
```
